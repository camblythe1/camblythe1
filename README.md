Key Insights â€“ Conversion Funnel & Retention Analysis (Excel-Based)
Tools used: Excel, Cohort Analysis, Funnel Metrics

Conversion Funnel Analysis revealed a 29.04% conversion rate from product views to shopping cart, but a significant drop to 10.34% from cart to purchaseâ€”highlighting friction in the final purchase step.

Despite the drop, the conversion rate from cart to purchase was 6.63% higher than from views to cart, suggesting that once customers added items to their cart, the checkout process was relatively seamless and well-optimized.

Cohort Retention Analysis (09/2020â€“02/2021) showed a consistent decline in monthly retention across all user cohorts, with all retention rates reaching 0.00% by February 2021.

The retention decline suggests potential product quality or satisfaction issues, with Cohort Age 1 showing initial engagement (12.5%) but failing to maintain user loyalty long-term.

Findings were used to recommend improvements to product quality and post-purchase experience, as well as a deeper review of the purchase funnel drop-off points.

ðŸ”¹ [Shopify App Analysis Project â€“ Power BI ](https://github.com/camblythe1/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uHUIXHBl6IhguRGeGUVuLxsCodFVTShxccOW_2_4dfM/edit?usp=sharing)
