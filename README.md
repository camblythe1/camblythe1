## ðŸ“Š Featured Projects
ðŸ”¹ [Restaurant Analysis Project â€“ Tableau](https://github.com/camblythe1/Restaurant-analysis-)  
A restaurant analysis project using data from Zamoto on Tableau to show what restaurants are popular and what restaurants generate the most revenue.

Key Insights â€“ Restaurant Analysis (2017â€“2020)
Tools used: Tableau, Data Visualization, Descriptive Analytics

Fast Food and Indian-Chinese cuisines demonstrated the highest and most consistent sales revenue, generating over $90M and $79M respectively across four yearsâ€”indicating strong market demand and scalability for a hybrid franchise.

Chain expansion strategy is directly tied to revenue success; for example, Dominoâ€™s, operating in 442+ cities, earned over $5M in revenue, outperforming smaller competitors regardless of rating.

Niche-style restaurants, while receiving higher average customer ratings (e.g., Gracie Italia rated 5.0), generated significantly lower sales revenue (e.g., $46K), showing that popularity does not always translate into profitability.

Despite modest growth in median sales revenue ($495 â†’ $565) and average revenue ($6,086 â†’ $6,628), the data highlights a disparity in earningsâ€”with large chains disproportionately capturing market share, reinforcing the advantage of brand scale and location volume.



ðŸ”¹ [Business Analytics Project â€“Excel ](https://github.com/camblythe1/Business-Analytics-Project/blob/main/E-commerce%20project.txt)
This project analyzes customer purchasing patterns for an e-commerce company to uncover insights that can drive marketing, inventory, and retention strategies. Using historical transaction data, we explored key metrics such as customer lifetime value (CLV), average order value (AOV), purchase frequency, and seasonal trends.

Key Insights â€“ Conversion Funnel & Retention Analysis (Excel-Based)
Tools used: Excel, Cohort Analysis, Funnel Metrics

Conversion Funnel Analysis revealed a 29.04% conversion rate from product views to shopping cart, but a significant drop to 10.34% from cart to purchaseâ€”highlighting friction in the final purchase step.

Despite the drop, the conversion rate from cart to purchase was 6.63% higher than from views to cart, suggesting that once customers added items to their cart, the checkout process was relatively seamless and well-optimized.

Cohort Retention Analysis (09/2020â€“02/2021) showed a consistent decline in monthly retention across all user cohorts, with all retention rates reaching 0.00% by February 2021.

The retention decline suggests potential product quality or satisfaction issues, with Cohort Age 1 showing initial engagement (12.5%) but failing to maintain user loyalty long-term.

Findings were used to recommend improvements to product quality and post-purchase experience, as well as a deeper review of the purchase funnel drop-off points.

ðŸ”¹ [Airbnb Market Analysis Project â€“ Excel ](https://github.com/camblythe1/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X4AqXpQZtOYiaDPmjDToYRvx_hOdfHQv0khL5iILOc0/edit?gid=1373177485#gid=1373177485)  
Conducted an analysis to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for vacation rentals, as well as the top revenue-generating listings. Utilized cleaned Airbnb data to uncover trends in demand and profitability. Delivered actionable insights to support client decisions on investment locations and optimal property configurations.

Key Insights
Harlem has the highest number of properties listed, totaling 445, making it the most saturated neighborhood in the dataset.

1-bedroom units are the most attractive property size, with 1,265 listings, indicating high demand or availability.

Based on Visual C, Listing ID 499465519 is the top-earning listing, generating a monthly revenue of $29,940.

Break down Harlemâ€™s listings by property size to understand which unit types are driving the high volume and whether certain sizes are more profitable within the neighborhood.

Since 1-bedroom units are the most common, further investigate why they are in high demandâ€”this could involve analyzing their locations, pricing, occupancy rates, or guest reviews to identify key success factors.

Investigate Listing ID 499465519 to understand the factors behind its top performance. Determine the neighborhood it's located in, the property features, pricing strategy, and customer feedback to identify patterns that can be replicated in other listings.
